## Introduction

Welcome to the BoulesBitesBar Full Stack Application repository! This project aims to enhance the features of the BoulesBitesBar website, providing an improved experience for users and administrators.

## Clean Code Principles

The codebase follows the Clean Code principles to enhance readability, maintainability, and collaboration. Some key principles include:

- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Functions and Methods**: Keep functions and methods short, focused, and do one thing.
- **Comments**: Use comments sparingly and only when necessary; prefer self-explanatory code over comments.
- **Code Formatting**: Consistently format the code using the agreed-upon coding style.

## Full Stack Development Process

Our full stack development process follows a systematic approach to deliver high-quality software. It includes the following stages:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Collaborate with stakeholders to gather and document project requirements.
2. **System Design**: Create a detailed design plan, including architecture and database design.
3. **Frontend Development**: Develop the user interface and client-side functionality.
4. **Backend Development**: Implement server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions.
5. **Testing**: Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure code quality and functionality.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the application to staging and production environments.
7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the application, fix bugs, and implement improvements.

## Git Process with Jira and Bitbucket

Our version control and project management process involves the use of Git, Jira, and Bitbucket:

1. **Issue Tracking with Jira**: Use Jira to create and manage tasks, user stories, and bugs. Each task should have a clear description, acceptance criteria, and assigned developer.
2. **Branching Strategy**: Follow a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to organize and manage code changes. Create feature branches for new features and bug branches for fixing issues.
3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**: For each feature or bug fix, create a pull request on Bitbucket. PRs should include a summary of changes, test results, and a list of related Jira issues.
4. **Code Review**: Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards and catch potential issues early in the development process.
5. **Continuous Integration**: Use Bitbucket Pipelines or a similar CI/CD tool to automate the build and testing process for each pull request.
6. **Merging and Deployment**: After a successful code review and passing CI, merge the pull request into the appropriate branch (e.g., develop or main) and trigger the deployment process.
